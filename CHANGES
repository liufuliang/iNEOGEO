v0.2 - 29/01/2012
-----------------
- Update SDL-1.3 patch to add BTStack & support wiimote. Still in development.
- Found a way to compile cyclone 68k emu core, leading to faster emulation. Now performances are very good on
iPhone 3GS.
- Also added some fast arm assembly video functions.
- Updated gngeo drivers to add ironclad support.

v0.1 - 26/01/2012
-----------------
- First version to init git repository
- CPU Cores: using mamez80 and generator68k. Planning to move to Fame/C for 68k emulation since generator
has some issues (at least with viewpoint and unaligned word access).
- Basic virtual pad implemented as PoC (Proof of Concept). iCade supported but buttons are currently hardcoded.
- Performances are very good on iPad and acceptable on iPhone 3GS (minimal testing done here on a few games).
- Blitter is using OpenGL (ES v1.0, unoptimized).

Usage:
------

- Put ROMS & Bios file (neogeo.zip) in iNEOGEO's Documents folder, using iTunes file sharing.
- For large roms (for ex, Metal Slug 3), you should use a gngeo dump (.gno file). You need to use 
gngeo windows/linux/osx for that. Just add "--dump" to your command line. 
Example: "./gngeo -i /my_roms_folder --dump mslug3"
